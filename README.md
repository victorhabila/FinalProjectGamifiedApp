# FinalProjectGamifiedApp

# Project Description
This project is carried out within the framework of the “Digital and Citizenship” chair, joint chair
between the ICP (Catholic Institute of Paris) and the ISEP.
Easy to Read and Understand Language (FALC) is a rule-based transcription
European standards, from classic language to language understandable by all. The people in
mental disability and intellectual disability are the first to be affected.
When intellectual disability can have a significant impact on a person's ability
to participate in activities and learn regularly, we aim to create a mobile application
which uses content specially designed to make learning in FALC more accessible,
engaging and efficient. This application must offer content adapted to the FALC,
gamification mechanisms and progress monitoring to help people with disabilities
intellectuals to develop their skills. The content to be developed is to be chosen from among the
useful and educational content for these people.
The goal of this project is therefore to develop a mobile application with interfaces and a
content in FALC, to help people with intellectual disabilities learn while playing
or to use it in their daily lives.
Specifications / Tasks
To carry out this project, you must:
• Discuss a state of the art on the subject;
• Choose inclusive and positive content and transcribe it into FALC according to the rules, such as
simple texts, images and exercises;
• Integrate gamification elements to motivate engagement in learning;
• Integrate progress tracking functionalities;
• Develop the mobile application using FALC for interfaces and content;
• Test the mobile application with people with intellectual disabilities.
Work organization / Expected deliverables
A formal modeling which formalizes the previous ideas, an operational model, a
implementation, and a test based on the real needs of people with intellectual disabilities
